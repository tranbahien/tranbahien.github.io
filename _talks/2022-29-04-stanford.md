<!-- The Bayesian treatment of neural networks dictates that a prior distribution is specified over their weight and bias parameters. This poses a challenge because modern neural networks are characterized by a huge number of parameters and non-linearities. The choice of these priors has an unpredictable effect on the distribution of the functional output which could represent a hugely limiting aspect of Bayesian deep learning models. Differently, Gaussian processes offer a rigorous non-parametric framework to define prior distributions over the space of functions. In this talk, we aim to introduce a novel and robust framework to impose such functional priors on modern neural networks for supervised learning tasks through minimizing the Wasserstein distance between samples of stochastic processes. In addition, we extend this framework to carry out model selection for Bayesian autoencoders for unsupervised learning tasks. We provide extensive experimental evidence that coupling these priors with scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling offers systematically large performance improvements over alternative choices of priors and state-of-the-art approximate Bayesian deep learning approaches. -->
